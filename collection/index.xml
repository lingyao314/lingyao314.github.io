      <description>In this video, I discuss the pros and cons of teaching during graduate school, how to find different types of teaching opportunities, and lessons I have learned from working as an instructor and a teaching assistant.
Thanks to Ryan McWay and Carmen Armas Montalvo for organizing the Applied Economics (APEC) Skills Series Workshop and for excellent video production.</description>

      <description>This template is originally forked from Anish Athalye&amp;rsquo;s gemini beamer poster template. To use it, click on the button at the top of this page and make a copy of the Overleaf project.
Colors and logo     I created a UMN beamer color theme to replace the genemi color theme, and named the color theme file in the root directory &amp;ldquo;beamercolorthemeumn.sty&amp;rdquo;. Among the UMN official colors, I used the UMN Maroon for title background and the UMN Gold for the main title.</description>
