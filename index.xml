      <description>In this video, I discuss the pros and cons of teaching during graduate school, how to find different types of teaching opportunities, and lessons I have learned from working as an instructor and a teaching assistant.
Thanks to Ryan McWay and Carmen Armas Montalvo for organizing the Applied Economics (APEC) Skills Series Workshop and for excellent video production.</description>

      <description>From February to May 2024, I taught Principles of Economics at St. Olaf College to two sections of students. Before this, I worked as a teaching assistant in designing an online version of the course at UMN in the Fall 2022 semester.
When I designed the course, I paid special attention to the before-class and after-class assignments to help students establish a consistent rhythm. Before classes, students would read a short article or a news piece related to the subject and briefly answer some reflection questions.</description>

      <description>I enjoyed watching Barbie the movie directed by Greta Gerwig. As I have been following the interviews and discussions around it, I ran into an interview of Margot Robbie, who played as Barbie. In the interview she shared a important lesson that she learned from watching the Barbie&amp;rsquo;s official YouTube channel. That is, swapping the preventive &amp;ldquo;sorry&amp;rdquo; for the word &amp;ldquo;thank you&amp;rdquo;. For example, instead of saying &amp;ldquo;sorry, I can&amp;rsquo;t do that&amp;rdquo;, say &amp;ldquo;thank you for understanding that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do that&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>University of Minnesota (unofficial) Beamer poster template</title>

      <description>This template is originally forked from Anish Athalye&amp;rsquo;s gemini beamer poster template. To use it, click on the button at the top of this page and make a copy of the Overleaf project.
Colors and logo     I created a UMN beamer color theme to replace the genemi color theme, and named the color theme file in the root directory &amp;ldquo;beamercolorthemeumn.sty&amp;rdquo;. Among the UMN official colors, I used the UMN Maroon for title background and the UMN Gold for the main title.</description>

      <title>Graduate level Econometrics</title>

      <description>Econometrics was among the most challenge courses I took in college. Admittedly, terms like &amp;ldquo;asymptotic&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;parametric&amp;rdquo; were just too abstract. After taking two versions of this course from different institutions and being the teaching assistant for four instructors that taught this course, I would say that I have climbed up on the spiraling ladder of learning enough to be no longer scared of it. Perhaps the best way to learn it is through viewing the same thing from different angles, and my favorite angle is through Professor Joe Ritter&amp;rsquo;s data simulation and visualization.</description>

      <description>This was a 45-hours summer course that I taught remotely in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. It offered new graduate students an opportunity to connect with each other and prepare for the core courses. Some of the students took the course during midnight while they were still restricted in their home country. Every year I am fascinated by how much students are devoted to learn, overcoming barriers of space and time, and even the crazy realities during the pandemic.</description>
