I feel as if we covered too much ground in not enough time, with not enough clear instruction or teaching. The outside work and homework often had a vast difference in difficulty compared to what we did in class, with the in-class activities often having little demonstration on how to complete the task. The exams and homework often have unclear, or contradictory, wording.

Another was the readings specifically adding a real world article to help us apply it to the real world and better understand it in the context of our own lives. ","One of the instructors greatest downfall was also the problem sets, while I do think they were helpful, they also required a lot from us--a lot of stuff that we weren't properly taught how to do, many hours of mine were spent in SI and with other students trying to find formulas, some of which were never given to us, and trying to remember when we learned this and how we were supposed to do it--I think that having us use the program was also unfair and should not be given to 121 students especially since we were barley taught how to do it. Another spot I think the instructor could improve is in the lectures, I think one of the biggest problems (the problem sets) could be improved if the instructor actually used the formulas and gave us an example in class on how to do it BEFORE just sending us out, expecting us to know how to do it even though we were never actually taught--examples in class would be helpful. ","I think that having a review sheet for before tests would be helpful, it often felt like I had no idea what was going to be on the test even though I had studied and came to our study sessions. The test often felt a lot harder than what we had done in class and even on the problem set, a review sheet may also be helpful as to help students see the gaps in their learning and were they need to ask for help. Lastly, I just want to say again that using the program in a 121 Econ class seems really absurd to me, this is an intro level course and that something you usually don't start doing until at LEAST a 200 level course--furthermore, we weren't even properly taught how to use it so it seems highly unfair to expect something of the degree from us."

I was often confused on course material and concepts and how the class worked. The slides were only helpful if you were there in class, so maybe embellish them a bit more so that someone who wasn't there could understand them or I could go back and try to learn the material outside of class. The assigned readings for each day weren't very applicable to the topic, and there was way too much reading out of the textbook for every class. A lot of the textbook reading was unnecessary and it took way too long to do. Maybe try finding alternate academic sources of information that we can learn from instead of the same textbook every time. ","Find new and clearer ways to explain topics. Go through slides clearly and encourage discussion and activity among students to check if they really understand or not. Try incorporating other types of activities and different readings into the class, and other ways to eat our knowledge (projects, performances, essays) instead of just quizzes and tests. Class was often not very exciting or engaging, and this would make it much more fun. Also try finding ways to connect what we are learning to the current world or our lives to keep us engaged."

","Class time was dedicated to application of concepts, but we did not spend much time actually understanding the concepts. The concepts discussed in the lecture then are expanded upon in class questions, but it would be beneficial to walk through an example or two with the professor. ","As a student in this course, there were many times where I felt like there was a key piece of information that was supposed to be grounding the concepts that we were learning. Spending time of the theories, and thought behind the application would benifical in then understand the application, such as how graphs move. "

The in-class examples MUST mirror the difficulty of the Problem Set and exam questions. Additionally, daily homework for this class had nothing do to with the questions on the Problem Sets or exams and was a waste of time as it did not contribute to my learning in a way that directly connected with course material.","I admire Yao's kindness and passion for economics, but her instruction skills need work. I am constantly lost in class and I feel that this course was far too difficult for the majority of my peers. "
