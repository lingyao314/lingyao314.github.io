      <description>From February to May 2024, I taught Principles of Economics at St. Olaf College to two sections of students. Before this, I worked as a teaching assistant in designing an online version of the course at UMN in the Fall 2022 semester.
When I designed the course, I paid special attention to the before-class and after-class assignments to help students establish a consistent rhythm.</description>

      <title>Graduate level Econometrics</title>

      <description>Econometrics was among the most challenge courses I took in college. Admittedly, terms like &amp;ldquo;asymptotic&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;parametric&amp;rdquo; were just too abstract. After taking two versions of this course from different institutions and being the teaching assistant for four instructors that taught this course, I would say that I have climbed up on the spiraling ladder of learning enough to be no longer scared of it. Perhaps the best way to learn it is through viewing the same thing from different angles, and my favorite angle is through Professor Joe Ritter&amp;rsquo;s data simulation and visualization.</description>

      <title>Math review for new graduate students in applied economics</title>

      <description>This was a 45-hours summer course that I taught remotely in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. It offered new graduate students an opportunity to connect with each other and prepare for the core courses. Some of the students took the course during midnight while they were still restricted in their home country. Every year I am fascinated by how much students are devoted to learn, overcoming barriers of space and time, and even the crazy realities during the pandemic.</description>
