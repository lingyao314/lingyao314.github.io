      <description>Econometrics was among the most challenge courses I took in college. Admittedly, terms like &amp;ldquo;asymptotic&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;parametric&amp;rdquo; were just too abstract. After taking two versions of this course from different institutions and being the teaching assistant for four instructors that taught this course, I would say that I have climbed up on the spiraling ladder of learning enough to be no longer scared of it. Perhaps the best way to learn it is through viewing the same thing from different angles, and my favorite angle is through Professor Joe Ritter&amp;rsquo;s data simulation and visualization.</description>
