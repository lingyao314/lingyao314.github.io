      <description>This was a 45-hours summer course that I taught remotely in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. It offered new graduate students an opportunity to connect with each other and prepare for the core courses. Some of the students took the course during midnight while they were still restricted in their home country. Every year I am fascinated by how much students are devoted to learn, overcoming barriers in space and time, and even the crazy realities during the pandemic.</description>
