      <description>Starting February 2024, I will join St. Olaf College as Adjunct Assistant Professor and teach the Principles of Economics (micro and macro).
In the Fall 2022 semester, I worked as a teaching assistant in designing an online version of the Principles of Economics course provided by the Department of Applied Economics, UMN. Click on the button at the top for the sample video lectures and slides that I made for the course.</description>

      <description>This was a 45-hours summer course that I taught remotely in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. It offered new graduate students an opportunity to connect with each other and prepare for the core courses. Some of the students took the course during midnight while they were still restricted in their home country. Every year I am fascinated by how much students are devoted to learn, overcoming barriers in space and time, and even the crazy realities during the pandemic.</description>
